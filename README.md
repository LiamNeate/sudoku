# Sudoku game
Creating a sudoku game in C++ to try and improve my C++ skills and knowledge.

I will simply start by creating an 9 x 9 sudoku grid with numbers 1-9.

I will randomly generate a new game everytime the user wants to play. The games will always be solveable.

I will have an end result that will hopeuflly utilise a GUI in C++ to make a user interface for the user. There will be validation checking on each input. If the input the user does is valid, it will show up on the grid.

There won't be any real time checking to begin with for each number to begin with (so the user can enter a wrong number but the game won't flag it up). This is to make the game more real, however, I might add difficulties and hints. The game will only say once the game has been completed.

I have started by making a simple python program for the basic parts of the system as python is my best language. I will then translate this into C++.

This project is meant to push my knowledge of C++ while also applying it to a project I am interested in. 

### Update

The project is currently functional for users to try however it is very basic functionality with minimal input checking. It is under _sudoku - C++/Grid maker (21.01.22)/_

Thanks for checking it out! Check the develper log for any updates on the project.
