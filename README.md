# Sudoku game
Trying to make a sudoku game in C++

I will simply start by creating an 8 x 8 sudoku game with numbers 1-4

I will randomly generate a new game everytime the user wants to play. The games will always be solveable.

I will create a ascii grid to show the currently found numbers. To put in numbers, the user will have to select the grid using a select system. This will probably be done using letters for each grid that is empty. There will be validation checking on each input. If the input the user does is valid, it will show up on the grid.

There won't be any real time checking to begin with for each number to begin with (so the user can enter a wrong number but the game won't flag it up). This is to make the game more real, however, have been thinking of adding an assist mode later. The game will only say once the game has been completed.
